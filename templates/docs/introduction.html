  <h1>Introducing the Studyclub platform</h1>
  <p>
    Late June 2020, students from across Canada were in disbelief when news came out that their semesters would be mostly or completely online. These students—including you—soon realized that they would have a tough time making meaningful connections with their peers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Studyclub is a platform that aims to sole this issue by connecting you with other students, with whom you will do rep-based studying, which has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to study.
