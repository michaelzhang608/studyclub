  <h1>What is "Rep-Based Studying?"</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    Rep-Based Studying, also known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a>, has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to study. Almost like a workout at the gym, you study as hard as you can for a short duration, then you take a break. During these breaks, you will be free to socialize with the two or three other students in your group. Once break is over, everyone goes back to studying. You repeat this whole process a few more times, for around two hours of studying in total.
  </p>
  <h4>Does each person in the group have to be studying for the same course?</h4>
  <p>
     No! You have complete freedom to choose what you will be studying. In fact, a great topic of discussion for time during the breaks is to try to summarize what you've been working on to the others as a way to ingrain what you've learned into your mind.
