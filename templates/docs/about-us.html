  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    Late June 2020, students from across Canada were in disbelief when news came out that their semesters would be mostly or completely online. Students soon realized that they would have a tough time making meaningful connections with their peers. Being a student myself, I wanted to improve the "University Experience" of students from across Canada.

  <h5>We'll be studying in from of our computer all day anyways, why not make it a little more fun?</h5>
